# YouTube-Like-Predictor

In this project, we aim to predict the number of likes for upcoming videos on a YouTube channel using machine learning. Our approach involves scraping data from the channel's previous videos and analyzing them to identify patterns and trends. We then use this information to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the number of likes for new videos based on their content and metadata.

Our project addresses the vital challenge faced by YouTube content creators in predicting and enhancing video engagement amid prolific digital content and fierce competition. Leveraging machine learning, we aim to provide creators with a data-driven tool, moving beyond intuition. 
By analyzing the channel's historical performance, our system empowers creators to refine content strategy, optimize engagement, and increase the likelihood of videos receiving substantial likes. Our motivation stems from the belief that merging data analytics with creativity elevates decision-making for creators, contributing to the evolution of impactful digital content on the YouTube platform.
